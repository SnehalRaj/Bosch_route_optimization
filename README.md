**Project:** To develop a route optimization algorithm that caters to the real time changing demand of customers to determine route and schedule of buses depending on the constraints provided.

**Presentation:** The presentation can be found [here](https://github.com/SnehalRaj/Bosch_route_optimization/blob/master/presentation.pdf)

**Data:** The data can be found [here](http://www.interiittech.org/static/pdfs/BOSCH_PS.pdf)


**Algorithm:**  Our algorithm is based on bottom up approach , that is , we start by first solving the smaller problems, and then we use their solution to solve bigger problems.

We will be finding optimised path for covering i+1 cities using solution of i cities.

**Note** These i cities will be a subset of N cities , i.e. we will be freely choosing any i cities out of these N . The only constraint that we will be varying is the exact number of cities.


So we will be finding solition of covering i number of cities such that the path end at city 1 , city 2 , city 3 .. and so on ..

Path[i][j] will be a vector storing i number of cities ( which are covered) , such that j is the starting point of the path.
We optimise total distance that we need to travel to cover any i cities such that the path ends at city j.

The base case is i = 1 , i.e. , we need to travel exactly 1 city .
The solution to this problem is trivial. For each j , we need to travel only 1 city , such that the path ends at city j . Ofcourse , only city j will be visited , and the lath will be an edge between centre and city j .

So , path[1][j] will contain only j as its element

Let us also maintain a 2-D array which will store the total distance that we need to travel to cover i cities such that path ends at city j . Let us call this array dist[i][j] .
So for our base case ( i = 1) , dist[1][j] will be equal to the distance between centre and city j
